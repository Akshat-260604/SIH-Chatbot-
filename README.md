# NavShiksha Chatbot

## Overview
The **NavShiksha Chatbot** is an intelligent conversational AI designed to assist users by providing relevant and accurate responses based on a knowledge base. It leverages state-of-the-art AI frameworks such as **LangChain** and **FAISS** to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach for enhanced conversational capabilities.

The chatbot is built to integrate seamlessly with the NavShiksha website, offering a user-friendly and efficient solution for answering queries and improving user engagement.

## Features
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines pre-trained language models with a custom knowledge base for precise and contextually relevant responses.
- **FAISS Similarity Index**: Efficient and scalable vector similarity search to retrieve the most relevant knowledge snippets.
- **LangChain Integration**: Enables dynamic chaining of prompts and responses for fluid and context-aware conversations.
- **Knowledge Base Support**: Easily customizable knowledge base that can be updated as per requirements.
- **Web Integration**: Designed for seamless embedding into the NavShiksha website.

## Architecture
1. **Knowledge Base Creation**:
   - Information is processed and embedded into vector representations using a pre-trained language model.
   - FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is used to index and retrieve the closest matching vectors based on user queries.

2. **RAG Workflow**:
   - The chatbot takes user input and retrieves relevant context from the knowledge base.
   - A pre-trained language model generates a response based on the retrieved information.

3. **LangChain**:
   - Manages prompt engineering and integrates retrieval and generation processes.
